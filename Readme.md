# FE1.1S_USB-HUB  
Some time ago, when I found a job for Intelligent Hardware, a company give me the task to draw a PCB in 1 day, yes, it's the written exam. I played too much first, then it had only half day. Luckily, I found the reference circuit. Then it's easy. I spent four hours to complete it. Here is the require:  

>附件是FE1.1S的Datasheet，这是一颗USB-Hub芯片，请画一块1转4口USB-Hub的板子，并带扩展电源输入。  
>1)PCB板材为FR-4，板厚1.6mm，铜厚1Oz。  
>2)要求提交原理图和PCB文件。  
>3)文件存储格式可以选择Altium Designer 09及以下或者Cadence SPB 16.3及以下。  

**FE1.1s_Data_Sheet_(Rev._1.0).pdf** is the datasheet.  
**fe1.1s应用电路.pdf** is the reference circuit. I change the power to two Micro-USB.  
Then it's the image of PCB:
